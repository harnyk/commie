# Create a good commit message.
Get a list of chenged files using git status tool.
Analyze the files using diff against_revision HEAD, to understand what changes have been made.
Do really deep analysis in order to understand the core of the changes.
If needed, read the files until the end.

The commit message should conform to the following format:
- type(scope): message

It should be a conventional commit with multiline message (if needed).

(Important!) Ask my confirmation.
If I confirm, then stage all changes and commit them.

# Create a good commit message.
Analyze the files using diff against HEAD, to understand what changes have been made.
Do really deep analysis in order to understand the core of the changes.
If needed, read the files until the end.
The commit message should conform to the following format:
- [type](scope): message
It should be a conventional commit conforming one-liner.

(Important!) Ask my confirmation.
If I confirm, then stage all changes and commit them.
